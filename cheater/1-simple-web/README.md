## How I Created this

`cd simple-web`
`npm init`

Install a Node server client [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
`npm install --save-dev http-server`

We use the node module `http-server` to take all the files from our command line and dispatch them up to a local server on our machine.


`touch index.html`
`touch app.js`
